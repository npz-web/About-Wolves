             <h5>Wolf Haven International was founded in 1982 by Steve and Linda Kuntz to provide 
                life-long sanctuary and care for captive-born wolves. Today, the sanctuary is accredited by
                 both the Global Federation of Animal Sanctuaries and the American Sanctuary Association and 
                 works to educate the public on the behavior and needs of wolves.</h5>

             <h5>The California Wolf Center was founded in 1977 by Paul and Judy Kenis to assist in the recovery 
                of wild wolf species through education, conservation, and research. Today, the charity is heavily 
                involved in captive breeding programs for wolves, including the endangered Mexican gray wolf.</h5>

            </div>
             <h5>The Committee for the International Wolf Center was founded in 1985 by a group of biologists led by 
                Dr. L. David Mech, after they consulted in a successful ‘Wolves and Humans’ exhibit at the Science Museum 
                of Minnesota. The International Wolf Center first opened its doors in June 1993 as an education hub to teach 
                local communities about wolves and to allow visitors to get up close and personal with these enigmatic but 
                misunderstood animals.</h5>

             <h5>The W.O.L.F. Sanctuary was founded in 1995 by Fred Johnston to improve the lives of wolves and wolf-dogs across 
                America. Today, the charity manages a successful sanctuary for wolves that have been rescued from unsuitable captive 
                environments..</h5>

             <h5>The Wolf Conservation Center was founded in 1999 by Helene Grimaud to protect two of the most endangered wolf species; 
                the Mexican gray wolf and the Red wolf. Today, the charity participates heavily in reintroduction programs for both species 
                and advocates for more protection for them in the wild.</h5>
