             <h5>The Committee for the International Wolf Center was founded in 1985 by a group of biologists led by 
                Dr. L. David Mech, after they consulted in a successful ‘Wolves and Humans’ exhibit at the Science Museum 
                of Minnesota. The International Wolf Center first opened its doors in June 1993 as an education hub to teach 
                local communities about wolves and to allow visitors to get up close and personal with these enigmatic but 
                misunderstood animals.</h5>

                the Mexican gray wolf and the Red wolf. Today, the charity participates heavily in reintroduction programs for both species

                study that revealed there were only around 500 of these animals left in the wild. It came about as a partnership between the Born 
                Free Foundation and the University of Oxford’s Wildlife Conservation Research Unit (WildCRU). Today, the charity is recognized as a 
                world leader in the field of carnivore conservation.</h5>

                Red wolf she decided she needed to act. She set up the American Wolf Foundation in her hometown of Missouri in the hope that her daughter would be able to 
                hear the characteristic howl of Red wolves in her lifetime. Today, the charity works to unite key stakeholders to ensure conflict-free conservation for all wolf species in America.</h5>
